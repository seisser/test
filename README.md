Assignment 1 and 2 is in respective folder. Assignment 3 is uploaded directly as an image in the repo.

NOTE ASSIGMENT 2:
The empty places in the sudoku board is represented by zeros. Due to time limit, the printed grid with empty places was not achieved so therefore the placeholder for an empty space for the user to fill in, is a zero.
