Assignment 1 and 2 is in respective folder. Assignment 3 is uploaded directly as an image in the repo.

NOTE ASSIGMENT 2!
The empty places in a sudoku board, that the player is supposed to fill in, is here represented by zero's.

(Because I didn't have time to create a more nice ASCII representation of a sudoku game, like a complete grid with empty squares to fill in etc)
