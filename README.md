Assignment 1 and 2 is in respective folder. Assignment 3 is uploaded directly as an image in the repo.

NOTE ASSIGMENT 2!
Because I didn't have time to create a more nice ASCII representation of a sudoku game (like a complete grid with empty squares to fill in etc):
The empty places in the sudoku board, that the player is supposed to fill in, is represented by zero's.
